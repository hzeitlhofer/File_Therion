File_Therion is a collection of classes representing objects specified by
Therion, a cave surveying application to manage the data and plans of small
to large cave systems.
Therions homepage is: http://therion.speleo.sk/

The pear classes allow parsing of such files, using the contained objects as
PHP object instances and also writing the objects to various targets (usually
files).


This readme is rather limited so far. The source code features comments and
also some examples. For now you may refer to the phpunit test cases to get
code examples (sorry).
For general therion usage please refer to therions documentation.
- Therion dokuwiki: http://therion.speleo.sk/wiki/doku.php
- Therion book (thbook.pdf): http://therion.speleo.sk/downloads/thbook.pdf

The package strives to closely match the logical therion data model as well
as its keywords and command names.
Please also refer to the generated APIdoc of the package. Method and class
names are hopefully named intuitively enough to get you started.
The unittests could also serve some examples, a good hint is the UseCases test.

Once ready, there will be a pear manual hosted at the PEAR home:
